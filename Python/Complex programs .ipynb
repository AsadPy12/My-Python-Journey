    "### Assignment: Employee Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a simple Employee Management System using Python. This system should allow users to perform basic operations such as adding new employees, viewing employee details, updating employee information, and removing employees from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1- Employee Database Setup:\n",
    "Initialize an empty dictionary named employees to store employee details. Each employee will be represented by a unique employee ID, and their information will be stored as a dictionary containing keys such as 'name', 'age', 'position', and 'salary'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2- Function to Add Employees:\n",
    "Write a function add_employee that takes employee details (name, age, position, salary) as input and adds a new employee to the employees dictionary. Ensure that the employee ID is unique and automatically incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3- Function to View Employee Details:\n",
    "Write a function view_employee that takes an employee ID as input and prints the details of the corresponding employee from the employees dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4- Function to Update Employee Information:\n",
    "Write a function update_employee that takes an employee ID and the updated information (name, age, position, salary) as input and updates the details of the corresponding employee in the employees dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5- Function to Remove Employees:\n",
    "Write a function remove_employee that takes an employee ID as input and removes the corresponding employee from the employees dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6- Menu System:\n",
    "Implement a menu system using a while loop where users can choose from the following options:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Add new employee                                                             \n",
    "- View employee details                                                           \n",
    "- Update employee information                                                     \n",
    "- Remove employee                                                                 \n",
    "- Exit the system\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7- Error Handling:\n",
    "Ensure that your program handles errors gracefully. For example, if a user enters an invalid employee ID or if the employee to be removed does not exist, display an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8- Efficiency Improvement:\n",
    "Implement a feature that calculates and displays the average salary of all employees in the system whenever the menu is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will not only help in practicing Python concepts like functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements but also in understanding how to create efficient and user-friendly business applications."
